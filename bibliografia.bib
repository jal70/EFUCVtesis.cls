    abstract = {{this article we briefly review the
central constructs in combinatorial opti-
mization and in statistical mechanics and
then develop the similarities between the
two fields. We show how the Metropolis
algorithm for approximate numerical
simulation of the behavior of a manybody
system at a finite temperature provides
a natural tool for bringing the techniques
of statistical mechanics to bear on
optimization.
We have applied this point of view to a
number of problems arising in optimal
design of...}},
